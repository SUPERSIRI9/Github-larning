# Wikis on GitHub

Every repository on GitHub.com is equipped with a **wiki section** for hosting documentation[web:1]. Wikis enable sharing of long-form content about a project, such as usage instructions, design details, or core principles[web:1]. While a README file summarizes what your project can do, a wiki offers a platform for **additional and more detailed documentation**[web:1].

## Access and Privacy

- If the repository is **private**, only users with at least read access can view the wiki[web:1].
- Wikis in public repositories are available to everyone[web:1].

## Creating, Editing, and Deleting Wiki Pages

### Creating a Wiki Page

1. Navigate to the repository.
2. Select the **Wiki** tab.
3. Click **Create the first page** if no pages exist or **New Page** to add a page[web:8].
4. Enter a title and content, then select **Save Page**[web:8].

### Editing a Wiki Page

1. Navigate to the wiki page to edit.
2. Click **Edit** at the top-right[web:8].
3. Make changes and select **Save Page**[web:8].

### Deleting a Wiki Page

- To delete, clone the wiki repository using Git, remove the relevant file locally, and push the change[web:8].

## Additional Features

- Wikis support **Markdown** as well as other formats for rich documentation, including diagrams and mathematical expressions[web:1].
- Users with write access can edit the wiki, but public repository wikis can optionally allow broader contributions[web:1].
- All wiki changes are tracked via Git commits, so you can review the edit history[web:11].

**Note:** Wikis are best for hosting detailed documentation and guides, and provide collaborative editing and version tracking within your GitHub repository[web:1].
