What are branches
In the last section, we created a new file and a new branch in your repository.

Branches are an essential part of the GitHub experience. They let you make changes without affecting the default branch.

Your branch is a safe place to experiment with new features or fixes. If you make a mistake, you can revert your changes or push more changes to fix the mistake. Your changes won't update on the default branch until you merge your branch.
