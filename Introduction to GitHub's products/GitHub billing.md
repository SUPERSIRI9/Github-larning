# GitHub Billing and Payments 💳

GitHub billing depends on your **account type** and **usage**.

---

## Account Types and Billing 🧾

- **Personal accounts** and most **organizations** get their own bills.
- **Enterprise accounts** can combine billing for many organizations and manage costs better.
- Bills include:
  - **Subscriptions:** Your plan (like GitHub Pro or Team) and fixed monthly fees for things like GitHub Copilot 🤖 or Marketplace apps 🛒.
  - **Usage-Based Charges:** Costs based on how much you use products like GitHub Actions (workflow automation) and GitHub Packages 📦.

## GitHub Actions Pricing ⚙️

GitHub Actions help automate tasks. Pricing depends on your repository type:

- **Public repositories:** Unlimited free minutes on GitHub’s servers. 🎉
- **Private repositories:** You get some free minutes depending on your plan, for example:
  - GitHub Free personal accounts get **2,000 minutes/month**.
  - Extra usage is managed by spending limits to avoid surprises. ⏰💰
